***Are there any complicated graph algorithm that involves a lot of computation and memory traffic like triangle counting and MSF?***

Answers from GPT-4:

1. All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP): This algorithm computes the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph. A widely used algorithm for APSP is Floyd-Warshall, which has a time complexity of O(V^3), where V is the number of vertices. The algorithm requires significant computation and memory traffic, especially for dense graphs.
   
2. Maximal Clique Enumeration: A clique is a subset of vertices in an undirected graph where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding an adjacent vertex. Enumerating all maximal cliques in a graph is computationally expensive, with worst-case time complexity of O(3^(V/3)), where V is the number of vertices.
   
3. Graph Isomorphism: The graph isomorphism problem asks whether two given graphs are isomorphic (i.e., have the same structure). While no polynomial-time algorithm is known for this problem in the general case, several practical algorithms like the VF2 algorithm, Nauty, and Bliss perform well on many graph classes. These algorithms can involve a significant amount of computation and memory traffic, especially for large and complex graphs.
  
4. Community Detection: Community detection algorithms aim to partition a graph into groups of vertices with higher intra-group connectivity and lower inter-group connectivity. There are various community detection algorithms like Louvain, Infomap, and Label Propagation, which can be computationally expensive and involve substantial memory traffic, especially for large and dense graphs.
   
5. Graph Partitioning: Graph partitioning algorithms divide a graph into smaller subgraphs with specific constraints, like minimizing the number of edges between subgraphs while maintaining a balanced number of vertices in each subgraph. Algorithms like Kernighan-Lin, Fiduccia-Mattheyses, and multilevel partitioning methods (e.g., METIS) can be computationally expensive and involve significant memory traffic for large and complex graphs.
