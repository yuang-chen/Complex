The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is an efficient method for finding all maximal cliques in an undirected graph. 
A maximal clique is a clique (a subset of vertices where every two vertices are connected by an edge) that 
cannot be extended by adding any adjacent vertex. The algorithm is a recursive, backtracking algorithm that 
explores the search tree of possible cliques.

The main idea of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is to maintain three sets of vertices during the search process:

* R: The current clique (partial solution).
* P: The set of candidate vertices that can be added to the current clique.
* X: The set of vertices that were already processed and cannot be added to the current clique.

The algorithm starts with an empty set R, the full set of vertices as P, and an empty set X. The algorithm recursively explores the search space by moving vertices from P to R and from P to X. When both P and X are empty, a maximal clique (R) is found and reported.

The basic steps of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm are as follows:

If both P and X are empty, report R as a maximal clique and return.
Choose a pivot vertex u from the union of P and X.
For each vertex v in P but not in the neighborhood of u, do the following:
* a. Add v to R, forming a new clique R âˆª {v}.
* b. Update P and X to contain only neighbors of v that are also in P and X, respectively.
* c. Recursively call the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm with the updated R, P, and X.
* d. Remove v from R and move it to X, marking it as processed.
The pivot vertex selection in step 2 helps to minimize the search space, as the algorithm explores only 
those vertices that are not neighbors of the pivot vertex.

The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm has been refined and improved over the years, with various optimizations and 
heuristics for pivot selection and vertex ordering. One notable optimization is the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm 
with vertex ordering, which sorts the vertices in P in a specific order to reduce the size of the search space.
Another variant is the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm with a degeneracy ordering, which orders vertices by their 
degree and processes vertices with the smallest degree first.


Several strategies can be used to choose a pivot:

1. *Arbitrary pivot selection*: The pivot is chosen randomly from the union of P and X. This method might not always provide the best results in terms of efficiency, but it's the simplest way to pick a pivot.
   
2. *Degree-based pivot selection*: The pivot is chosen as the vertex with the highest degree (the number of edges connected to the vertex) in the union of P and X. This method aims to minimize the search space by selecting a pivot that is connected to many vertices, thus reducing the number of candidates that can form cliques with the pivot.
   
3. *Degree-density-based pivot selection*: The pivot is chosen as the vertex with the highest degree-density in the union of P and X. Degree-density is the ratio of the vertex's degree to the size of the set it belongs to (P or X). This method aims to balance the trade-off between the vertex degree and the set size.
Maximal Neighborhood-based pivot selection: The pivot is chosen as the vertex with the maximum number of neighbors in the union of P and X. This method ensures that the algorithm explores only those vertices that are not neighbors of the pivot vertex, further reducing the search space.

4. *Degeneracy ordering*: The vertices are ordered by their degree, and the algorithm processes vertices with the smallest degree first. This ordering aims to optimize the algorithm's performance by minimizing the size of the search tree.
These pivot selection strategies help reduce the search space and improve the algorithm's performance. However, the choice of the best pivot selection strategy depends on the specific characteristics of the graph and the problem. In practice, different strategies may be more suitable for different types of graphs and applications.
